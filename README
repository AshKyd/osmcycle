This is the stylesheet that currently drives Briscycle on
[http://briscycle.com/].

== Requirements ==
This stylesheet requires several things:

* Database settings set up in datasource-settings-sample.xml.inc.
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik#Contours Contours] must be set up in the database, or %land-contours; be commented out in styles.xml.inc.
* [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik#World_Boundaries World Boundaries] set up somewhere and referenced in layers.xml.inc.

The Mapnik article on the OSM wiki has a great tutorial for setting up 
a mapnik rendering system on your local machine but you could also 
run this with mod_tile with some optimisations.
